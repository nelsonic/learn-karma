Not only can *data* be "real" but so can *testing* (in "real" browsers)!

#### What is Karma?

If you've never heard of Karma, prepare to have your mind blown! :-)

**Official Description**: Karma is a [test automation] tool that spawns a web
server and executes source code against test code for each of the browsers
connected. The results for each browser are examined and displayed via the
command line so developers can see which browsers and tests passed or failed.

In other words, you can **automatically** test all your front-end code
in **any** / **all** your target browsers each time you save your work.

#### Why is Karma Awesome?

You don't have to *think* about switching contexts to run your tests.
Simply save the file you are working on and Karma's watcher will
automatically instruct all the connected browsers to re-run the tests.

Imagine you have 10 browsers you need to test your code against:
[Internet Explorer 7/8/9/10, Firefox 3.5/Latest, Chrome, Safari Mac/iOS, Opera]
If the target browsers are all on the machine that is running Karma,
you would simply add them to the configuration file and Karma would manage
them for you.

Any browsers on machines/devices can connect to Karma over the internet and
run tests simply by pointing the browser at the Karma server:
http://test.acme.com:9876/ *or* using a service like http://localtunnel.me
to make your development machine accessible outside of your network.

Once the browser is connected to Karma it will run all the tests for you
on auto-pilot and respond with test results.


#### Get Started

If you are learning by cloning this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-karma.git
```
then install dependencies (karma and jasmine) locally:

```sh
npm install
```

Otherwise, if you are going to run Karma for all your projects
(because you think its *awesome*):

```sh
sudo npm install -g karma
```

As of version 0.12

```sh
sudo npm install -g karma-cli
```


#### Karama Configuration (File)

Run the Karma initilisation (*wizard*) to create your configuration file:

```sh
karma init
```

Go through each step and select the defaults.
You can always change them manually in your **karma.config.js** file.

Once you are through the wizard, initiate Karma:

```sh
karma start karma.conf.js
```

This will open a browser window (what ever the default on your computer is)
with the url: `http://localhost:9876/`
